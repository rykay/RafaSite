I’ve always been a believer that Rafa’s dominance at the French Open and on clay courts in general is one of the greatest achievements throughout sports history. I think telling Rafa’s story, including his quick rise to fame, and his dominance at one of the biggest tournaments and surfaces would give insight on just how insane of an athlete and competitor he is!
